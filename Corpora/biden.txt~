You’re all going to have a lot of questions, but I want to focus on the issue today, the judiciary, as well as we were talking about the Attorney General’s office. And so I’ll have plenty of time to ask the questions I know you desperately want to ask about everything from 25th Amendment on, but I’m not going to speak to that today. I want this to be the issue that we focus on because I think it’s so important. Yesterday, in my view, one of the darkest days in the history of our nation, an unprecedented assault on our democracy. An assault, literally, on the citadel of liberty, on the United States Capitol itself. An assault on the rule of law. An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings, ratifying the will of the people in choosing the leadership of their government. All of us here grieve the loss of life, grieve the desecration of the people’s house. What we witnessed yesterday was not dissent. It was not disorder. It was not protest. It was chaos. They weren’t protesters. Don’t dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob. Insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists. It’s that basic. It’s that simple. And I wish we could say we couldn’t see it coming, but that isn’t true. We could see it coming.

The past four years, we’ve had a president who’s made his contempt for our democracy, our constitution, the rule of law, clear in everything he has done. He unleashed an all-out assault on our institutions of our democracy from the outset. And yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack. He’s attacked the free press who dared to question his power, repeatedly calling the free press the enemy of the people. Language, at the time he first used it, I and others said has long been used by autocrats and dictators all over the world to hold onto power. The enemy of the people. Language that is being used now by autocrats and dictators across the world, only this time with the imperator of an outgoing President of the United States of America.

He’s attacked our intelligence services, who dare tell the American people the truth about the effort of a foreign power to elect him four years ago, choosing instead to believe the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of those who’ve sworn their allegiance to this nation, many of whom had risked their lives in the service of this nation.

He deployed the United States military, tear gassing peaceful protestors in pursuit of a photo opportunity in the service of his reelection, even holding the Bible upside down. The action that led to an apology from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an outspoken denunciation of the use of military for domestic political purposes, from scores, scores of former military leaders and Secretaries of Defense, led by Secretary Cheney. He thought he could stack the courts with friendly judges who would support him no matter what, they were Trump judges, his judges. He went so far as to say he needed nine Justices on the Supreme court because he thought the election would end up in the Supreme Court and they would hand him the election.

He was stunned, truly stunned, when the judges he appointed didn’t do his bidding and instead acted with integrity, following the constitution, upholding the rule of law, not just once or twice or three times, but over 60 times. Let me say it, over 60 times. In more than 60 cases, in state after state after state, and then at the Supreme Court judges, including people considered “his judges”, Trump judges, to use his words, looked at the allegations that Trump was making determined they were without any merit.

Nothing was judged to put this election in question or doubt by any of these judges. You want to understand the importance of democratic institutions in this country, take a look at the judiciary in this nation. Take a look at the pressure it was just subjected to by a sitting president of the United States of America. At every level, the judiciary rose in the moment during this election, did its job, acted with complete fairness and impartiality, with complete honor and integrity. When history looks back in this moment that we’ve just passed through, I believe it will say our democracy survived in no small part because of the men and women who represent an independent judiciary in this nation. We owe them a deep, deep debt of gratitude.

And then there’s the attack on the Department of justice, treating the Attorney General as his personal lawyer and the department as his personal law firm. Through it all, we would hear the same thing from this president, my generals, my judges, my Attorney General. And then yesterday, a culmination of an attack on our institutions of democracy. This time, the Congress itself. Inciting a mob to attack the Capitol, to threaten the elected representatives of the people of this nation, and even the vice president, to stop the Congress from ratifying the will of the American people in a just, completed, free and fair election.

Trying to use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 million Americans who summoned the courage in the face of pandemic that threatened their health and their lives to cast that sacred ballot. I made it clear from the moment I entered this race that what I believe was at stake. I said there was nothing less at stake than who we are as a nation, what we stand for, what we believe, what we will be. At the center of that belief is one of the oldest principles this nation has long held, where our government of laws, not of men, not of the people, of laws. I said it many times in the campaign, our democratic institutions is not relics of another age, they’re what sets this nation apart. They’re the guardrails of our democracy. That’s why there is no president who is a King. No Congress that’s a House of Lords. A judiciary doesn’t serve the will of the president or exist to protect him or her. We have three co-equal branches of government. Co-equal. Our president is not above the law. Justice serves the people. It doesn’t protect the powerful. Justice is blind. What we saw yesterday, in plain view, was another violation of the fundamental tenet of this nation. Not only did we see the failure to protect one of the three branches of our government, we also saw a clear failure to carry out equal justice.

 used to say in the Senate, excuse a point of personal privilege. Well, over an hour and a half after the chaos started, I got a text from my granddaughter Finnegan Biden, who is a senior in her last semester at University of Pennsylvania. She sent me a photo of military people in full military gear, scores of them lining the steps of the Lincoln Memorial because of protest by Black Lives Matter. She said, “Pop, this isn’t fair.” No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that storm the Capitol. We all know that’s true and it is unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. The American people saw it in plain view. I hope it’s sensitizing what we have to do.

Not many people know it, when Justice Garland and I were talking, we talked about, I think he raised it. The reason for the Justice Department’s forming in the first place. It was back in 1870. We didn’t have a Justice Department before that cabinet. It was formed in 1870 to enforce the civil rights amendment that grew out of the Civil War. The 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. To stand up to the Klan, to stand up to racism, to take on domestic terrorism. This original spirit must again guide and animate it’s work.

So as we stand here today, we do so in the wake of yesterday’s events, events that could not more have vividly demonstrated some of the most important work we have to do in this nation. Committing ourselves to the rule of law in this nation. Invigorating our domestic and democratic institutions. Carrying out equal justice under the law in America. There is no more important place for us to do this work than the Department of Justice that has been so politicized. There’s no more important people to carry out this work than the people I’m announcing today. More than anything, we need to restore the honor, the integrity, the independence of Department of Justice in this nation that has been so badly damaged. And so many former leaders of that department in both parties have so testified and stated that.

I want to be clear to those who lead this department, who you will serve. You won’t work for me. You are not the president or the vice president’s lawyer. Your loyalty is not to me. It’s to the law, the Constitution, the people of this nation, to guarantee justice. For Attorney General of the United States, I nominated a man of impeccable integrity, Judge Merrick Garland, one the most respected jurists of our time. Brilliant, yet humble. Distinguished, yet modest. Full of character and decency. The Supreme Court clerk served in the Justice Department during the Carter, Bush 41, and Clinton administrations, where he embraced the department’s core values of independence and integrity. A Federal prosecutor who took on terrorism and corruption and violent crime, always with the utmost professionalism and the duty to the oath he swore.

Nominated by President Clinton to be a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the second most powerful court in America. Throughout such a long and distinguished career, Judge Garland has earned the praise and admiration of members of bench and bar, and politicians of both parties. And despite his busy schedule and prestigious positions, he still makes time to volunteer regularly, tutoring students in Northeast DC, as he’s done for 20 years. It’s about character. It’s about character.

… it’s about character, it’s about character. It was no surprise why President Obama nominated him, Judge Garland, to the Supreme Court. As I said he embodies honor, decency, integrity, fidelity to the rule of law and judicial independence. To those same traits, he will now bring as Attorney General of the United States, not as a personal attorney to the president, but as the peoples’ lawyer. He’ll restore trust in the rule of law and equal justice under the law. And I fully expect, in the discussions I’ve had, that he will receive a fair hearing and a swift confirmation. And once he’s confirmed, I will move promptly to nominate his replacement on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. I expect that the distinguished nominee will receive a prompt and fair hearing as well. For Deputy Attorney General, I nominate one of the most selfless people I’ve worked with, one of the brightest I’ve worked with. I worked with her during the last administration. A 15 year veteran of the Justice Department, Lisa Monaco. Lisa knows the department inside and out. She is a definition of what a public servant should be; decent, trusting, honorable. And I might add I embarrassed her a moment ago with her other colleagues, and selfless. I offered her other positions that are of “greater consequence,” more prestige. But she wanted to work with you, Judge. She wanted to go back to the Justice Department. A top  prosecutor, took on public corruption, corporate fraud and violent crime. Chief of Staff to the Director of the FBI. The first woman ever confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for National Security, where she elevated cyber security to a top priority. And where it’s even more consequential today, than it was then.

At the White House, she was the top Homeland Security and Counter Terrorism advisor to President Obama and me, at every one of the national security meetings. She coordinated our fight against Al-Qaeda and ISIL. She helped lead our response to the Ebola Crisis. When the bombs went off at the finish line on Patriot’s Day in Boston, her hometown, she coordinated the Federal Governments response with local and state law enforcement to get to the bottom of the horrible tragedy. Lisa, I know, I know you will help restore integrity and independence of the Department of Justice that you so revere.

As Associate Attorney General, the number three job at the department, I nominate Vanita Gupta. A woman I’ve known for sometime. One of the most respected Civil Rights lawyers in America. Started a career at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Then onto to ACLU, both organizations to which I belong. And then to the Justice Department during the Obama-Biden administration, where she led the Civil Rights Division. At every step, with every case, she fought for greater equity and the right to right the wrongs of a justice system, where they existed. And she’s done so by bringing people together, earning praise from across the  spectrum for her approach to solving some of the thorniest problems we face.

During the Obama-Biden administration, Vanita was put in charge of investigating the abuse of power in police departments in Ferguson, Missouri and other communities torn apart by acts of violence and racial injustice. She helped institute a common sense police reforms to build greater equity, safety, and trust. She was commended for her work by both law enforcement and those advocating for changes in the criminal justice system. That’s a rare achievement. And it speaks volumes about her capacity to unite people in common purpose, which is what this is all about. Uniting the American people.

Born in Pennsylvania, a proud daughter of immigrants from India, that sound familiar?

If confirmed, Vanita will be the first woman of color to serve as Associate Attorney General. And I’m grateful, I’m grateful that Vanita is leaving her current job, leading one of the premier Civil Rights organizations in the world, as she answers the call to serve once again to ensure that our justice system is even more fair, and more equitable. Thank you.

For Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, I nominate Kristen Clarke who has spent her career advocating for greater equality and equity in our justice system. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants. Now don’t think this has been designed here. I’m still looking for an Irishman. All kidding aside, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Kristen is also one of the most distinguished Civil Rights Attorneys in America. A proud native of Brooklyn, New York, she began her legal career in the very same office she’s now nominated to lead. Her previous tenure with the Justice Department saw her take on some of the most complex Civil Rights cases, from voting rights, to redistricting challenges, to prosecuting hate crimes and human trafficking. She’s earned accolades throughout her career, including as the head of the Civil Rights Bureau for her home state of New York, where she’s led the charge to end the school to prison pipeline and root out discrimination in housing and in law enforcement. She currently leads one of the nations top Civil Rights organizations, where she promotes greater equity, and voting rights, in our education system, in our housing system, in our justice system, and so much more.

Now, she’ll return full circle to pursue the vital work where her career began. The Civil Rights division represents the moral center of the Department of Justice. And the heart of that fundamental American ideal that we’re all created equal and all deserve to be treated equally. I’m honored you accepted the call to return to make real the promise for all Americans.

To each of you, I thank you for your service, and to your families. And to the American people, this is a team that will restore your trust and faith in our institutions democracy. I chaired the judiciary committee for many years. One of my goals in running in the first place, you may recall, I said when I saw those people coming out of the fields on Charlottesville shouting hate, a young woman killed. And when asked the president said they there are good people on both sides. That’s literally why I ran. There’s no more important and heartfelt effort on my part than restoring, restoring the independence and integrity of our justice department.

So may God bless you all. May God protect our troops and those who are sworn to protect the American people. Now I will turn it over to the team, starting with the next Attorney General of the United States, Judge Merrick Garland. Thank you.

Are Sorry. Not just an inconvenience, but I’m sorry for the reason we’ve delayed, I’ve delayed coming out to speak to you. I initially was going to talk about the economy, but all of you, all of you have you been watching what I’ve been watching. At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault, unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times, an assault the Citadel of Liberty, the Capitol itself, an assault on the people’s representatives and the Capitol Hill Police sworn to protect them, and the public servants who work at the heart of our Republic. An assault on the Rule of Law, like few times we’ve ever seen it. An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings, the doing of the people’s business.

Let me be very clear. The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are. What we’re seeing are a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not the dissent. It’s disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition, and it must end now. I call this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward. You’ve heard me say before in different contexts, the words of a President matter, no matter how good or bad that President is. At their best, the words of a President can inspire. At their worst, they can insight.

Therefore, I call on President Trump to go on national television now, to fulfill his oath and defend the constitution and demand an end to this siege. They storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks on the Capitol, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly-elected officials. It’s not protest. It’s insurrection. The world’s watching. Like so many other Americans, I am genuinely shocked and saddened that our nation, so long, the beacon of light and hope for democracy has come to such a dark moment. Through war and strife, America’s endured much and we will endure here and we will prevail again, and we’ll prevail now. The work of the moment and the work of the next four years must be the restoration of democracy, of decency, honor, respect the Rule of Law, just plain, simple decency, the renewal of a politics.

It’s about solving problems, looking out for one another, not stoking the flames of hate and chaos. As I said, America is about honor, decency, respect, tolerance. That’s who we are. That’s who we’ve always been. The certification of the Electoral College vote, it’s supposed to be a sacred ritual, which we affirm, it’s purpose is to affirm the majesty of American democracy. But today’s reminder, a painful one, that democracy is fragile and to preserve it, requires people of goodwill, leaders who have the courage to stand up, who are devoted, not to the pursuit of power or their personal interests, pursuits of their own selfish interest at any cost, but at the common good. Think what, our children watching television is thinking. Think what the rest of the world is looking at. For nearly two and a half centuries, we, the people, in search of a more perfect union, have kept our eyes on that common good. America is so much better than what we’ve seen today.

Watching the scenes from the Capitol, I was reminded as I prepared other speeches in the past, I was reminded of the words of Abraham Lincoln in his Annual Message to Congress, whose work has today been interrupted by chaos. Here’s what Lincoln said. He said, “He shall nobly save or merely lose the last best hope on Earth.” He went on to say, The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just. A way, which if followed, the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless.” The way is playing here too. That should we are. It’s the way of democracy, of respect, of decency, of honor and commitment as patriots to this nation. Not withstanding what I saw today, we’re seeing today, I remain optimistic about the incredible opportunities. There’s never been anything we can’t do, when we do it together. This God-awful display today, is bringing it home to every Republican and Democrat and Independent in the nation, that we must step up.

This is the United States of America. There’s never, ever, ever, ever, ever been a thing we’ve tried to do, that we’ve done it together, we’ve not been able to do it. So, President Trump, step up. May God bless America and may God protect our troops and all those folks at the Capitol who are trying to preserve order. Thank you, and I’m sorry to have kept you waiting.

It’s good to be back. It’s good to be back. Let’s hear it for Allie, and that introduction, and a great line up of entertainers you’ve had. You’re probably disappointed, you’re not speaking. We’ll get the entertainers back out here.

And let’s hear it for Stacey Abrams.

Nobody, nobody in America has done more for the right to vote than Stacey. Stacey, you’re a change in Georgia. You’ve changed America. And I want to personally thank you again. So let’s hear it for the next Public Service Commissioner, Daniel Blackman. I don’t know where Daniel is, but I know he’s here. Look, and one of the best Mayors America has, and my good friend, Keisha Lance Bottoms. If I had three of her, I could rule the world.

I love her, I tell you. And let’s hear it for the next United States Senators Jon Ossoff and the Reverend Warnock. I was just talking with them in the back. They’re talented. They’re principled. They’re qualified. They’re decent. They’re honorable. They mean what they say and they believe what I believe the definition of America is. It’s about possibilities, unlike any other nation in the world, anything’s possible.

They’re bending the arc of history towards justice and hope and progress. And that’s not hyperbole, that’s real. Folks, this is it. This is it. It’s a New Year. And tomorrow can be a new day for Atlanta, for Georgia, and for America.

First, let me start by saying thank you for electing me and Kamala as President and Vice President of the United States. You voted in record numbers in November. Your voices were heard. Your votes were counted. And the rule of the people prevailed. We won, three times here. Each recount, you know what I mean? I think we should count it as three states. We won three times. And now, we need for you to vote again in record numbers, to make your voices heard again and again, to change Georgia, to change America again. And this is not an exaggeration. Georgia, the whole nation is looking to you to lead us forward, for real. You know it. You cannot turn on any national television show without knowing about what’s going on here and what you all are doing. The power, the power is literally in your hands. Unlike any time in my career, one state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation.

 By electing Jon and the Reverend, you can make an immediate difference in your own lives, the lives of the people all across this country. Because their election will put an end to the block in Washington, that $2000 stimulus check, that money would go out the door immediately, to help people who are in real trouble. Think about what it will mean to your lives, putting food on the table, paying rent

Lives, putting food on the table, paying rent, paying part of your mortgage, paying down the credit card, paying the phone bill, the gas bill, the electric bill. Just look around. Millions of people in this country out of work through no fault of their own. No fault of their own. They’re struggling. Many are fearful and many have given up hope. Look at the lines at food banks, hours and hours and hours. This is the United States of America, for God’s sake and there are food lines like we’ve not seen since the depression and they’re getting longer. Families, children, people who have worked their whole lives and never asked for a thing except a fighting chance, now, they’re lining up for food in America and the debate over $2,000 isn’t some abstract debate in Washington, it’s about real lives. Your lives, the lives of good, hardworking Americans and if you’re like millions of Americans all across this country, you need the money, you need the help and you need it now.

Look, Georgia there’s no one in America with more power to make that happen than you, the citizens of Atlanta, the citizens of Georgia and that’s not an exaggeration. That’s literally true. If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people who are struggling right now, and if you send Senators Perdue and Loeffler back to Washington, those checks will never get there. It’s just that simple. The power is literally in your hands by electing Jon and the reverend you can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington and this nation.

With their votes in the senate, we’ll be able to make the progress we need to make on jobs, on healthcare, on justice, on the environment and so many important things. By electing Jon and the reverend, you’ll be voting to get the states the resources they need to get the vaccines distributed. It’s a shame what’s happening now. It’s a literal shame. I’ve said it before, getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficult operational challenges this nation’s ever faced but we’ve known it for the last months.

This administration has gotten off to a God-awful start. The president spends more time whining and complaining than doing something about the problem. I don’t know why he still wants the job, he doesn’t want to do the work. Look, the states need help. There’s a reason why the constitution said the federal government could have a deficit spending in times of crisis and states have to balance their budgets. It’s for this very thing. It’s the whole idea, your states have to balance your budgets. So what’s happening? You’re going to see more and more people laid off, more firefighters, police officers, school teachers, first responders, the people we need badly now. The states need more money to do the job. They need to the federal government to work with them, not attack them and leave them out there hanging.

It’s going to be tough to get this done, but we have to do it. People’s lives literally depend on it. Our economy depends on it and we’ll get it done by electing Jon and the reverend to be voting to get their states and local government funding the money they need to keep cops, firefighters, teachers, local responders, keep them on the job protecting you, looking out for your children.

Look, states have been struggling through this pandemic. They need help, by electing Jon and the reverend you’ll be sending a powerful message to congress and to the country. It is time for this nation, for god’s sake to finally come together, finally to work together, to unite, to put the anger and the division and the divisive politics to the past, behind us and here’s one more thing, voting for Jon and the reverend won’t just be good for America, it’ll be good for Georgia and here’s why.

When you vote for Jon and Raphael, you’ll be sending two senators who will fight for you, who will put Georgia first, who’ll put you first. You don’t have that now. You have two senators that thinks it’s more important to reward wealth than hard work in a tax system. You have two senators now who think they don’t work for you, they work for Trump. I mean it, think about it. You have two senators, who think their loyalty is to Trump, not to Georgia. You have two senators who think they’ve sworn an oath to Donald Trump, not to the Unites States Constitution but let me tell you something.

I got elected when I was 29 years old and six more times the United States Senator from Delaware and guess what, not once did I think I took an oath to any president, democrat or republican. I took an oath to the United States Constitution and as president, I don’t believe the United States senators are going to work for me, they work for the people of Georgia. That’s why I’m not asking your senators to be loyal to me, I believe they should be loyal to you, to Georgia, the United States Constitution, period and if you vote for Jon and the reverend, that’s what you’re going to get, decent, honorable men.

They won’t put a president or party first and they sure won’t put themselves first. They know public service is about you. It isn’t about them. It’s not about enriching themselves. It’s about making people’s lives better, about giving people a chance, just an even shot, no guarantee but an even shot. It’s time to start rewarding work and not wealth and if you listen to Jon and the reverend, that’s what they’ve been saying, that’s what they’ve been campaigning on.

Look, I’m dealing with COVID. I’m revitalizing our economy, our healthcare, our voting rights, criminal justice, racial justice, climate change and the things that matter and will make a difference in your lives and the lives of your families. Georgia, as dark as these days of winter seem, I’m still more optimistic about this country than any time in my entire life. I really mean it. The American people now understand clearly what’s at stake and Jon and Raphael share that optimism. They saw firsthand the power of believing in the promise of America in our darkest months. Jon learned it from my old friend and yours, John Lewis.

Reverend Warnock sees the power of faith overcome the toughest trials that life can throw at us. He believes as I do, in the quote of the German philosopher, Kierkegaard who said, “Faith sees best in the dark.” I know they share with me that deep faith in the American people in this country, a faith that enables us to overcome adversity, to lift each other up, to be a beacon of light for one another and for the world. That’s who we are and that we should never give up on.

Look folks, I’ve said many times and I’ll say it here again, there’s nothing and I say this again, nothing, nothing, nothing this country isn’t able to do when we decide to do it together. We have faced tougher times before and we’ve always overcome. We’ve always overcome. We’ve always come out better than we went in, no matter what. I know this campaign has been exhausting. You put the hard work in over the last few years to get to this moment. It’s been intense. It’s been non-stop but I’m asking you to give everything you’ve got one more day, one more day and that one more day, this not hyperbole, you can change America.

So if you haven’t voted, vote. If you’ve already voted, then I’m asking you one more day of making calls, and safely knocking on doors. Go to iwillvote. com/GA to find your polling location. Just like you did in November, vote, vote, vote. Vote for Jon and the reverend. Vote. In America, as our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people, from the people.

That’s our history. That’s our law. That’s our tradition. That’s our constitution. That’s our democracy. Politicians cannot assert, take or seize power. Power if given, granted by the American people alone and we can never give that up. It’s always, always the will of the people must prevail. So today, tomorrow vote. Make sure your voice is heard. Do it for yourselves, do it for your families, do it for your children, do it for your state, your country. Do it for all those who’ve given up so much. Think of all those who’ve given up so much to secure that right. Do it for the country you love, because I know you love this country and the future you want to build for everyone in this country.

Do it for all those around the world who aspire like us to be free and a democratic people who look to us. I’ve been in almost a hundred countries, they all look to America. The power, the power is in your hands. Jon, and Reverend Warnock, we’re counting on you, so is Kamala, so am I and so is America. We’re a nation built on honor, decency, dignity and respect. America is and must continue to be a beacon of light, liberty and democracy and unity. That’s who we are. That’s the United States of America. Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.

Federal, state and local law enforcement are working around the clock to gain more information on motive and intent. This bombing was a reminder of the destructive power that an individual or a small group can muster and the need for continuing vigilance across the board.

I want to thank the police department in Nashville, particularly those five police officers who worked so quickly to evacuate the area before the explosion occurred, risking their own lives. And for all the firefighters and first responders who jumped into action early on that Christmas morning, last Christmas morning. Their bravery and cool headedness likely saved lives and prevented a worse outcome, and we are internally grateful to that law enforcement agency. And I know the hearts of all Americans are with the people of Nashville as they rebuild and recover from this traumatic event.

Now Vice President Harris and I, along with our nominees that lead the national security institutions have just been briefed by some of the professionals who have been conducting agency reviews as a part of our transition. This a long standing part of the orderly transition of power in American democracy. We welcome teams from the incoming Trump Pence Administration four years ago, gave them access to all that we had. And over the past few weeks, teams of genuine policy and management experts, many of them previous government experience who have gone into agencies across the government to conduct interviews with personnel, to gather information and to assess the state of the federal government, excuse me, that we will shortly inherit.

These teams worked under incredibly difficult circumstances, taking COVID-19 precautions and waiting weeks for the ascertainment, meaning that so they could go in and be cleared to go in, but they have done an outstanding job. For some agencies, our teams received exemplary cooperation from the career staff in those agencies. From others, most notably the Department of Defense, we encountered obstruction from the political leadership of that department. And the truth is, many of the agencies that are critical to our security have incurred enormous damage. Many of them have been hollowed out in personnel, capacity and in morale. In the policy processes that have atrophied or have been sidelined, in the despair of our alliances and the disrepair of those alliances, and our absence from key institutions that matter to the welfare of the American people. And the general disengagement from the world and all of it makes it harder for our government to protect the American people, to defend our vital interests in a world where threats are constantly evolving and our adversaries are constantly adapting.

Rebuilding the full set of our instruments of foreign policy and national security is a key challenge that the Vice President elect Harris and I will face upon taking office, starting with our diplomacy. Today, we heard from the leaders of the state and USA ID agency review teams about the critical early investment we’re going to need to make in our diplomacy and our development efforts and in rebuilding our alliances to close the ranks with our partners and bring to bear the full benefits of our shared strength for the American people.

When we consider the most daunting threats of our time, we know that meeting them requires American engagement and American leadership, but also that none of them can be solved by America acting alone. Take climate change, for example. The United States accounts for less than 15% of the global carbon emissions, but without clear, coordinated and committed approach from the other 85% of the carbon emitters, the world will continue to warm. Storms will continue to worsen. Climate change will continue to threaten the lives and livelihoods, and public health and economics of our existence and our, literally, the very existence of our planet.

We’ve learned so painfully this year the cost of being unprepared for a pandemic that leaps borders and circles the globe. If we aren’t investing with our partners around the world to strengthen the health systems everywhere, we’re undermining our ability to permanently defeat COVID-19 and we’re leaving ourselves vulnerable to the next deadly epidemic. And as we compete with China to hold China’s government accountable for its trade abuses, technology, human rights, and other fronts, our position would much stronger when we build coalitions of like-minded partners and allies that make common cause with us in defense of our shared interest and our shared values.

We make up only 25%, almost 25%, of the entire economy of the world, but together with our democratic partners, we more than double our economic leverage. On any issue that matters to the US and China relationship from pursuing a foreign policy for the middle class including a trade and economic agenda that produces and protects American workers, our intellectual prosperity and the environment to ensure security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. To championing human rights, we’re stronger and more effective when we’re flanked by nations that share our vision and the future of our world.

That’s how we multiply the impact of our efforts to make those efforts more sustainable. That’s the power of smart, effective American leadership. But right now there’s an enormous vacuum. We’re going to have to regain the trust and confidence of a world that has begun to find ways to work around us or work without us.

We also heard from key leaders of our intelligence and defense review teams, including Stephanie O’Sullivan, former Principal Deputy Director of the National Intelligence and retired Army Lieutenant General, Karen Gibson. We talked about the different strategic challenges we’re going to face from both Russia and China and the reforms we must make to put ourselves in the strongest possible position to meet those challenges. That includes modernizing our defense priorities to better deter aggression in the future, rather than continuing to overinvest in legacy systems designed to address threats of the past.

We have to be able to innovate, to reimagine our defenses against growing threats in new realms like cyberspace. We’re still learning about the extent of the SolarWinds Hack and the vulnerabilities that have been exposed. As I said last week, this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security. We need to close the gap between where our capabilities are now and where they need to be to better deter, detect, disrupt, and respond to those sorts of intrusions in the future. This is an area Republicans and Democrats are in agreement, and we should be able to work on a bipartisan basis to better secure the American people against malign cyber actors.

And right now, as our nation is in a period of transition, we need to make sure that nothing is lost in the handoff between administrations. My team needs a clear picture of our force posture around the world and our operations to deter our enemies. We need full visibility into the budget planning underway at the Defense Department and other agencies in order to avoid any window of confusion or catch up that our adversaries may try to exploit.

But as I said from the beginning, we have encountered roadblocks from the political leadership at the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget. Right now, we just aren’t getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas. It’s nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility.

Finally, we spoke about the day one challenge that we’re going to need to address immediately, drawing on the skillset of the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We were briefed on the steps needed to clean up the humanitarian disaster that the Trump Administration has systematically created on our southern border. We will institute humane and orderly responses. That means rebuilding the capacity we need to safely and quickly process asylum seekers without creating near term crisis in the midst of this deadly pandemic.

These are hard issues and the current administration has made them much harder by working to erode our capacity. It’s going to take time to rebuild that capacity. We’re going to work purposely, diligently and responsibly to roll back Trump’s restrictions starting on day one, but it is not as simple as throwing a switch to turn everything back on, especially amid a pandemic. We’ll have to have a process to ensure everyone’s health and safety, including the safety of asylum seekers hoping for a new start in the United States, free of violence and persecution. Of course, an essential part of this will be managing the safe, equitable, and efficient distribution of vaccinations to as many Americans as possible as quickly as possible. FEMA has an enormous part to play in this. And we heard from the former FEMA director, Craig Fugate, today. Want to make sure that our administration is poised to make full use of FEMA’s domestic reach and capacity in managing our COVID response.

And finally, from every briefer, I was heartened, I was literally heartened to hear about the incredible strength we’ll be inheriting in the career professionals and working people across these agencies. They never stopped doing their jobs and continue to serve our country day in and day out to keep their fellow Americans safe just as they’ve always done. These agencies are filled with patriots who’ve earned our respect, and who should never be treated as political footballs. I’m looking forward to the honor of working with them again, to asking further advice and inputs, to help shape the best possible policies for all Americans. I want to thank the incredible folks who’ve served on these agency review teams as part of this transition. They’ve dedicated their time and energy, their vital experience and expertise to help ensure Vice President Harris and I are ready to hit the ground running. And we look forward the start of a new year, fresh with hope and possibilities for better days to come, but clear-eyed about the challenges that will not disappear overnight.

I want to reiterate my message to the American people. We’ve overcome incredible challenge as a nation, and we’ve done it before and we will do it again. We’ll do it by coming together, by uniting after years of pain and loss, a year particularly needed to heal, to rebuild, to reclaim America’s place in the world. This is the work that lies ahead of us and I know we’re up to the task. We will champion liberty and democracy once more. We will reclaim our credibility to lead the free world. And we will once again lead, not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

Our economy is poised to come back and come alive and I can see a return to normalcy in the next year. I also see incredible opportunities for our nation in the years ahead in job creation, clean energy, racial equality, and much more. But we need to be honest. The next few weeks and months are going to be very tough, a very tough period for our nation, maybe the toughest during this entire pandemic. I know it’s hard to hear but it’s the truth. As Roosevelt said, “I think the American people can take whatever we tell them if we tell them straight from the shoulder.” We need to steel our spines for what’s ahead. We need to follow even more closely the recommendations to slow the spread of the virus. And each of us needs to do what we can to protect ourselves, our families and our fellow Americans. We’re going to get through this. Brighter days are coming but it’s going to take all the grit and determination we have as Americans to get it done.

So today I want to be clear about five things every American should know about our efforts to contain COVID-19 and where the vaccine stands today. First, things are going to get worse before they get better. In September, we passed a grim milestone, 200,000 deaths. At that time, in this very room many of you remember I warned that we hit 400,000 deaths before the end of the Trump administration in January. Critics said I was being too alarmist and negative but as I’ve said all along I will tell you like it is when it comes to COVID and the reality is it looks like that we’re going to hit that grim milestone. We’ve just crossed 330,000 deaths in America. We’re averaging daily death rates of nearly 2,200 people which means we’ll lose tens of thousands of more lives in the months to come.

Hospitals are being stretched beyond capacity and that’s data before we see the impact of the cases coming from the recent holidays and this upcoming holiday of New Year’s Eve. People getting infected today don’t show up in cases for weeks and those who perish with the disease die weeks after initial exposure. So we have to anticipate that the infections over the holidays will produce soaring cases counts in January and soaring death tolls into February. Turning this around is going to take time. We might not see improvement until we’re well into March as we’ll take time for our COVID response plan to begin to produce visible progress.

The second thing to know is the Trump administration’s plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind, far behind. Were grateful to the companies, the doctors, the scientists, the researchers, the clinical trial participants and Operation Warp Speed for developing the vaccines quickly. But as I long feared and warned the effort to distribute and administer the vaccine is not progressing as it should. A few weeks ago, the Trump administration suggested the 20 million Americans could be vaccinated by the end of December. With only a few days left in December we’ve only vaccinated a few million so far. And the pace of the vaccination program as moving now, if it continues to move as it is now, it’s going to take years, not months to vaccinate the American people.

Which brings me to the third thing every American should know, the Biden Harris administration will spare no effort to make sure people get vaccinated. I’ve laid out three challenges in our first 100 days. One of them is ensuring that 100 million shots have been administered by the end of the first 100 days. If Congress provides the funding we’d be able to meet this incredible goal. It would take ramping up five to six times the current pace to one million shots a day. But even with that improvement, even if we boost the speed of vaccinations to one million shots a day, it will still take months to have the majority of the United States population vaccinated.

I’ve directed my team to prepare a much more aggressive effort with more federal involvement and leadership to get things back on track. We’ll find ways to boost the pace of the vaccinations but as Dr. Fauci and others have stated these past few days this will take more time than anyone would like and more time than the promises from the Trump administration have suggested. This is going to be the greatest operational challenge we’ve ever faced as a nation but we’re going to get it done but it’s going to take a vast new effort that’s not yet underway.

And that gets me to the fourth thing that we should know, I’m going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction. I’m going to use my power under the Defense Production Act when I’m sworn in and order private industry to accelerate the making of the materials needed for the vaccines as well as protective gear. Vice-president Harris and I had been speaking with county officials, mayors, governors of both parties to speed up the distribution of the vaccines across the nation. We’re planning a whole government effort and we’re going to work to set up vaccination sites and send mobile units to hard to reach communities.

And we also know there’s a vaccination hesitancy in many communities, especially black, Latino, Native American communities, who have not always been treated with the dignity and honesty they deserve by the federal government and the scientific community throughout our history. That’s why we will launch a massive public education campaign to increase vaccine acceptance. We’ll do everything we can to show the vaccines are safe and critically important for one’s own health and that of their families and the communities. That means we’re also going to make sure vaccines are distributed equitably so every person who wants a vaccine can get it no matter the color of their skin or where they live. And we’re going to ensure vaccinations are free of charge.

Fifth, while the pandemic rages on and as we increase the supply, distribution and administration of the vaccine we have to remain vigilant. As part of the 100 day challenge I’m going to be asking the American people to wear a mask for the first 100 days of my administration. It’s not a political statement, it’s a patriotic duty. Our administration are going to require a mask wearing where I have the power to do so for federal workers, in federal facilities and interstate travel like planes and trains. And we’ve been working directly with county officials, mayors, governors, to implement mask mandates in their cities and their towns and their states. Masking has been a divisive issue in this country but COVID is a killer in red states and blue states alike. So I encourage you all to wear a mask, encourage your family and friends to do the same. It’s one of the easiest things we can do that will make a huge difference to save lives.

Another 100 day challenge is opening most of our K through eight schools by the end of the first 100 days in the spring. Look, we can only do that if Congress provides the necessary funding so we get schools, districts, communities, and states the resources they need for those so many things that aren’t there already in a tight budget. They need funding for testing to help reopen schools, more funding for transportation so students can maintain social distances on buses. They need it for school buildings, for additional cleaning service, protective equipment, ventilation systems. This is going to require an additional tens of billions of dollars to get this done.

And Congress also needs to fund and provide more protective equipment for frontline health workers who are still reusing masks and gowns. We need to scale up testing so anyone who needs one can get a test. After 10 months of the pandemic we still don’t have enough testing, it’s a travesty. All this vaccination, testing, protective gear is going to require more funding from Congress, more than was just approved. That’s why I’ll propose a COVID action package early next year and challenge Congress to act on it quickly.

Look, my ability to change the direction of this pandemic starts in three weeks. With thousands dying every day between now and then let me conclude by discussing what needs to happen now. I congratulate the bipartisan majority on passing and the president on signing the COVID relief bill. It’s still, even though it’s a step, an important step, still a move in the right direction and it will help people in need. And it’ll pay for some but not all of what we need to fix the COVID response. It’s a down payment but now with that done I hope the president will also clearly unambiguously promote masks wearing. I give former governor Chris Christie credit. He and I have disagreed in a number of things but I’m thankful he’s now encouraging people to do the right thing and wear a mask for themselves, their loved ones and their country. I hope that President Trump will listen to him. He can do it too. It would make a huge difference for President Trump to say wear masks.

I hope the president will clearly and unambiguously urge all Americans to take the vaccine once it’s available. I took it to instill public confidence in the vaccine. President elect Harris took hers today for the same reason. And when the president’s doctor’s recommend it President Trump should take it and it’s still the same degree of confidence.

Let me also say this to the American people, we can save all the experts tell us between 60 and 100,000 lives in the weeks and months ahead if we just step up together, wear a mask, socially distance, wash our hands, avoid large indoor gatherings. I know all of these are not easy to ask but I’m asking you to make a sacrifice. You’re already making tremendous sacrifices every single day. It’s hard on your lives, on your livelihoods, on your kids, on your families. It’s not small what we’re asking of you but we’re in this together and the actions we take now are going to help us contain the pandemic and get us back to our lives and to our loved ones.

So the American people to all of you I know there’s a lot we have to do but I want you to know there’s also much we can do. We’re the United States of America. We’ve been through hard times before as a nation and we’ll come through this as well. I promise you we will. So please, I wish you a happy new year. May God bless you and may God protect our troops. Wear a mask.
